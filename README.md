# my_portfolio

This is my portfolio which I created using Nodejs with serverside rendering. Among other things,

- I worked with Firebase hosting and file storage.
- I worked with github api for retreiving and displaying repositories I've worked on.
- I worked on twilio api for notifying me when an email has been submitted.
- I worked on an express api for sending emails.
